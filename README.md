# PrisonersHats
This project implements several strategies to [prisoners and hats puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_and_hats_puzzle).

It originated as a desire to check strategies to [Matt Parker's last variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hJ4Azr--s8) on the riddles.

The principle is to generate random lists of hats, run a strategy on them and check the result.

Of course this does not make any proof that a strategy is optimal, but it helps making confident that it works and is effective  :smiley:.
